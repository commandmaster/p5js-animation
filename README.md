# P5js Animation Addon Library


## Installation
To install the library simply download the latest version of the p5.animate.js from the releases section and include the file in your index.html file. Make sure to include the script tag after the p5js tag.\
As of now, there is no CDN available so the only way to use the library is to add the js file to your project.

```
<script src="./p5.js"></script>
<script src="./p5.sound.min.js"></script> // You can ignore this line if you don't have the p5 sound library in your project 
<script src="./p5.animate.js"></script>
```
