# Animate.js

## Overview
This is a p5js addon library that includes basic animation functionality for p5js. The user can create animators which are placed on the canvas. 
Each animator contains animations which can be created using sprite sheet images. 

## Installation
To install the library, download the [latest version of p5.animate.js from the releases section](https://github.com/commandmaster/p5js-animation/releases/latest) and include the file in your index.html file. Include the script tag after the p5js tag.
Currently, no CDN is available, so the only way to use the library is to add the js file to your project.

```
<script src="./p5.js"></script>
<script src="./p5.sound.min.js"></script> // You can ignore this line if you don't have the p5 sound library in your project 
<script src="./p5.animate.js"></script>
```
